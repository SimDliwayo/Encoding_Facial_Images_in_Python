# Cool Image Encoding Project

This project demonstrates how to encode images into vectors using Python. It's designed to work with a set of sample images, but you can also use it with your own images, including selfies!

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.

2. Navigate to the parent directory of the project in your terminal or command prompt.

3. Install the required dependencies by running:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Place your images (including selfies if you want) in the `Sample Image Data Set` folder.

2. Run the script:

   - If you're using Python 3, run:
     ```
     python3 lambda_handler.py
     ```
   - On some systems, you might use:
     ```
     python lambda_handler.py
     ```

3. The script will process all `.jpg` images in the `Sample Image Data Set` folder and output the encoded vectors.

## What's Happening?

This script encodes each image into a vector representation. These encodings can be used for various machine learning projects, such as image classification, similarity comparison, or as input features for neural networks.

## Customization

Feel free to modify the `lambda_handler.py` script to suit your specific needs. You can adjust the image processing steps, change the output format, or integrate it with other parts of your ML pipeline.

## Happy Coding!

We hope you find this tool useful for your machine learning projects. Don't hesitate to experiment and expand upon this code!
